# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, removing, updating, and searching for students. Additionally, it provides features like sorting, filtering, and generating performance summaries. This system is ideal for educational institutions or anyone needing to manage student data in a structured manner.

## Code Structure

### Classes
1. **`Student`**:
    - Represents a student with attributes: `name`, `ID`, `age`, `GPA`, `year`, and `department`.

2. **`StudentSystem`**:
    - Manages a list of students and provides methods for adding, removing, updating, searching, sorting, filtering, and generating summaries.

### Methods
- **Input Validation**:
    - `inputValidName`, `inputValidID`, `inputValidAge`, `inputValidGPA`, `inputValidYear`, `inputValidDepartment`, `inputValidChoice`.
- **Student Operations**:
    - `addStudent`, `removeStudentByID`, `updateStudentByID`, `searchByID`, `listAndSortAllStudents`, `filterByAge`, `filterByGPA`, `filterByYear`, `filterByDepartment`, `countTotalStudents`, `calculateAverageGPA`, `displayTop5`, `displayFailingStudents`, `countStudentsByYear`, `generateSummary`.
